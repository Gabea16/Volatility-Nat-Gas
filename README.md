# Volatility-Nat-Gas

# This project is primarily to showcase basic visualization skills and python competencies. Volatility is an extremely relevant metric in trading, so I decided to measure out and visaulize volatility using spot prices over the past 10 years. I take a couple of different approaches to volatility here, including a rolling 2 day average and an average over the entire series. Along with volatility, I also provided a basic visualization of Nat Gas Spot Prices over the past decade, showing various peaks and troughs in prices.
